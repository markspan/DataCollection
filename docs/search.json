October 2024\n\nCoordinator: Mark Span (m.m.span@rug.nl)]\nInstructors: Mark Span; Olaf Dimigen\nGuest lecturers: Sebastiaan Mathôt, Ana Vilotijeviç\n\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to design, program, and conduct a psychophysical experiment; and you will learn how to analyse the data sets. Students will participate in a pupil dilation experiment of which the data will be analysed in class. Techniques required to analyse this type of data (e.g., processing of markers and selection of analysis windows) are learned. For this, the programming language “Python” will be used. Students will, in groups, build their own pupil dilation experiment using “OpenSesame” and will collect data. Assessment will consist of assignments, and the report written about the experiment and data analysis. The report will take the form of a short journal paper, and a more extensive report of the data analyses.\nAfter taking this hands-on course, students:\n\nare able to design and implement a psychophysiological experiment in which pupil dilation and eye movements are recorded\ncan use tools to analyse and present data collected in such experiments. \n\n\n\n\nThe first goal of the course is to explore literature for a pupillometry study that you find interesting. You will aim to replicate the experimental findings of this study: either an exact replication or a replication with a small adaptation to the design (e.g., change stimulus modality). In the ideal scenario, you will collect and analyse your own data in week 40 upto 43 (see Course Outline below).\nYou will work together in groups that you form in the first meetings. Although you will work in groups, you are expected to submit the assignments individually (except for Assignment 1 and 5).\nThis is a “hands-on” course and therefore most of our meetings take the form of a practicum. The required theoretical knowledge for the practicums is discussed in the form of lectures. Generally, our Wednesday meetings will be theoretically oriented and our Friday meetings practically oriented.
